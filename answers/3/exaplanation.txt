Explanation:
Data Model:

WeatherStats table is created to store the calculated statistics, including the station ID, year, average maximum temperature, average minimum temperature, and total accumulated precipitation.
Python Code:

Database Connection: Uses SQLAlchemy to connect to the PostgreSQL database for ease of use with Pandas.
Data Loading: Loads weather data from the WeatherData table.
Statistics Calculation: Groups the data by station_id and year, calculates the average maximum and minimum temperatures (ignoring missing values), and sums the precipitation (converting it to centimeters).
Data Insertion: Inserts the calculated statistics into the WeatherStats table.
This approach ensures that the statistics are accurately calculated and stored, making it easier to perform further analysis or reporting.
