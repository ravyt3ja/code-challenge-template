Explanation:
Logging Setup:

Configures logging to record the ingestion process start and end times, and the number of records ingested.
Database Connection:

The get_db_connection function establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database.
Data Handling:

The handle_missing_values function converts missing values (-9999) to None.
The ingest_data function reads the data file into a DataFrame, processes it, and inserts it into the database. It uses the ON CONFLICT clause to avoid inserting duplicate records.
Ingestion Process:

The main function iterates over all text files in the wx_data directory, calling the ingest_data function for each file.
Logs the total number of records ingested and the duration of the process.
By running this script, you will ingest the weather data into your PostgreSQL database, handle duplicates, and produce log output indicating the process details.
